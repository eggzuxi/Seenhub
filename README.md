This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

### Welcome to SEENHUB
This is my little corner of the internet where I can record all the amazing music, movies, books, and more that I’ve discovered – just for me. No audience, no pressure. Think of it as my personal treasure chest of vibes, where I’m the only one with the key (but hey, feel free to peek if you’re curious).

Oh, and just a heads up – SeenHub is still in its baby stage, so there isn’t much here yet.🙂

배포할 계획 있음

### Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
